## Log

### R1D1 
Apr-13 - Initialized a git repository to rebuild a website for a friend's family business. Unfortunately their old one was hacked from not updating Wordpress plugins. I will be using Bootstrap as the framework and we'll see from there! Javascript, jQuery, a little Backend action perhaps? Firebase... who knows at this point!

I will be working with this project alongside working through a Full-stack Code Camp at the University of Richmond that I started back in January!. LET'S GO!!!

### R1D2
Apr-14 - CodeCamp Class day! Worked with MySQL today. Learned quite a bit using @nodejs to access and add to a database! 
  - Set up an app to add, update and remove songs to a MySQL database
  - Started another app, "GreatBay" which is somewhat of an eBay type idea. Created another database of products and an interface to as a user whether they will be posting a new item or bidding on active items. Used Node packages 'mysql' to access the database and 'inquirer' to interact with the user.

Didn't get to work much on my side project but maybe this evening or tomorrow! I am also working on my Resume (Part of an assignment through code-camp but defintely long over-due).
