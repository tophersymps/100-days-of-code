## Log

### R1D1 
Initialized a git repository to rebuild a website for a friend's family business. Unfortunately their old one was hacked from not updating Wordpress plugins. I will be using Bootstrap as the framework and we'll see from there! Javascript, jQuery, a little Backend action perhaps? Firebase... who knows at this point!

I will be working with this project alongside working through a Full-stack Code Camp at the University of Richmond that I started back in January!. LET'S GO!!!

### R1D2
